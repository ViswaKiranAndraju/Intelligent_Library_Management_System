# Intelligent_Library_Management_System

The Intelligent Library Management System project aims to develop a comprehensive library management
system that uses the latest web technologies and computer vision algorithms to efficiently and accurately manage
library resources. The system is designed to address the challenges associated with traditional library management
systems by integrating inventory management, student management and book classification functions. This project
is a web-based application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js for the front end and MySQL for the
back end. The system provides an easy-to-use interface that allows students and librarians to easily browse and
access library resources. The system’s inventory management features ensure that library inventories are current by
allowing librarians to add, modify, and delete book records. Additionally, the system’s book classification feature
uses computer vision algorithms to automatically classify books by subject and genre, making it easier for librarians
to find books on each shelf. The project’s student management features allow librarians to manage student records
and borrowing histories, including book issuance and return. The system keeps records of all books published and
returned, and produces detailed reports on all expired books. The system also includes a student log feature that
records when students enter and leave the library and provides librarians with information on student attendance
patterns. By using computer vision technology in the project, the system can efficiently classify books based on
genre, subject matter, and shelf placement. The system captures images of returned books with cameras and uses
computer vision algorithms to process the images and locate the books on the shelf. This system eliminates the need
for manual classification and frees librarians to focus on other important tasks. In summary, a library management
system is a comprehensive solution that provides an efficient and precise approach to library resource management.
The system uses computer vision algorithms to ensure that books are accurately categorized and placed on their
respective shelves. The Student Management feature also provides librarians with a convenient and reliable way
to manage student files and track book borrowing history. With an intuitive interface and robust feature set, this
project is poised to revolutionize the way libraries are managed and improve the user experience for both students
and librarians
